Technically speaking, our kids are gifted with various degrees of incentive and/or innovative prowesses. 

To harness these inventive talents and practically empower these kids, two things are needed; 

1. R&D TrustFund
2. Research Collaboration Centre:
   To copiously research and develop a given concept or idea, fund is required. Since these kids lack the needed fund for Research&Development, ArtKids~ICT has created a TrustFund called 'ArtKids Inventors TrustFund' through which ArtKids Inventors are adequately funded.\
