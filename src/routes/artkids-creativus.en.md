'Us' and 'We' are magical words when it comes to Mutually Benefitial Ventures (MBVs). 'Us' and 'We' gave birth to 'Company'. 

As no one tree can make a forests, "it takes two to tango". 
Unfortunately, the lack of win-win collaborations is the reason why most Africans are weak and poor. Compare them to Europeans, Americans, Russians and Asians; you will see that collaboration is the top_most secret of industrial successes. 
In these parts of the world, "people work with people".
Through ArtKids CreativUs programme, mutually benefitial collaborations are encouraged. 

By pulling resources together (Intellect, Concepts, finances, manpower, materials, organization, raw materials, ideas, HR etc.) mutually benefitial (win-win) long-lasting relationship between the collaborating parties is cemented. 
This is the purpose of ArtKids CreativUs programne under ACBi.
