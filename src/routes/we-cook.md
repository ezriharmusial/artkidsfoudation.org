"All works and no food makes kids weak and weak kids".
One who learns to cultivate, plant, irrigate, nurture and harvest the food should do marvelously well in also knowing how to cook the food he or she produced. 
We-Cook is an Artkids programne through which kids are taught how to cook the food they produced.
In this programme, kids are taken to the market to buy some of the ingredients they did not produce (as no one produces all ingredients). This way, kids are exposed to purchases and costs of ingredients in our markets. Childishly, kids participate in pricing and purchases (fun).
Once the enlisted ingredients are complete, guided by an adult, kids prepare a delicious food using some of the ingredients they produced in KidsFarm. Thereafter, the meal is served and eaten together as one family. 
That's KidsFarm
